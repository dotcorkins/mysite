<p>To preface this; I wasn't alive for this so my knowledge is small. <br>What is the oldweb project? Well; there isn't an 'OldWeb project' perse but the growing idea that the new, centralized web plauged with things like SEO and such is kinda bad. More and more boomers are talking about "The good old days!" where 'Web surfing' was a thing. Where the internet was a small collective of cool independent sites. That sounds cool to me and other people. Imagine a world where Instead of trying to learn about VPNS or if you even need one from a corporate website payed for by VPN companies you could have just found a website of lets say.. Bob! the network engineer from Minnesota who points out that if you're the average person, the data you send to a website is already encrypted if they use the HTTPs protocol which is the majority nowadays. And one hallmark of the old internet was the Links page. (a.k.a blog-roll etc..) where you could go down rabbit holes on plenty of topics, learning new things and being entertained for a long stetch of time. So I have decided to add one, I assume you have already seen it on the NavBar. I might write about this more. I just thought it was cool, and if it doesnt pick it up, I'll try and do it.  </p>

		<p>This is my new website. This was HEAVILY inspired by the website of <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless software.</a> Go check them out and use it, if you're on linux. "Why is this website so barren?" you may ask, well; 1: i suck at html/css 2: i think those overly styled websites look kinda bad, also they're bloated as heck. Which gets me on a tangent! The modern web is WAY too bloated, it must suck to use it in other countries. I could be wrong but I heard that a decently slow connection here is a normal connection anywhere else outside of NA. Anyways- I also just have a dislike of JS and it's many flavors. It doesn't help that I dont understand it too. </p>
